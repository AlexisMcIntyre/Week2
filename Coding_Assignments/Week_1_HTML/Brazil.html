        quirks about the country.

            <h2>Fun Facts:</h2>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Fried tapioca might possibly be the best food on the face of the earth. Or in the galaxy.</li>
                <li>A filet mignon and wine dinner for 2 costs $41 USD!! Feel like a boss on a budget! LOL</li>
                <li>Eu quero tomar um cafezinho!!! Who would have thought Brazil would have the *cutest* little coffees (cafezinhos)?</li>
                <li>A manicure *and* pedicure costs $5 USD. Yes, you read that right!</li>
                <li>You don't actually have to be on time for anything.</li>
                <li>There is no such thing as "bedtime". </li>
                <li>Enjoy doing your laundry the old-fashioned way-by hand! Don't be fooled by the "machine"--it doesn't actually do anything. And don't forget your gloves!</li>
                <li>There are 3 ingredients in every meal: beans, rice, meat. With a side of juice.</li>
                <li>Ever wanted to know everything your neighbors are doing at all hours? Neither do I. But now you know.</li>
