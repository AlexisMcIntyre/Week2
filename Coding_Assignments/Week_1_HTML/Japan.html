        <h1>Japan</h1>
        <p>
            Ohayo gozaimasu! I went to Japan in 2009 with a small group of friends. We stayed in Tokyo and were able to 
            go to the country to visit my friend's relatives. What an interesting experience--being in Japan feels
            like you are on another planet. Everything down to the smallest detail is considered in design!

<!--In this next section I added a bunch of pictures. They are in the same folder as this document so I just had to specify the file name. I gave them all alt text so that an image search could more likely pull them up, and so if the picture didn't load, the text would show in its place. I alo gave them a standard width.-->
